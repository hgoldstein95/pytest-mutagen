# Successes

* **bidict**
Found 7 relevant mutants and proposed a Pull Request with new properties covering these problems
* **flask** 
Unveiled several problems on mutagen, and has a pretty good coverage but we still found one relevant mutant

# Abandoned

* **yacluster** 
Good coverage, did not find any problem
* **cryptography**
Based on test vectors so mutagen is irrelevant
* **qutebrowser**
Lot of fails in the install and the test
* **axelrod**
Lot of fails in the tests and uses unittest rather than pytest

# Pending

* **hyper-h2**
*  **RubyMarshal**
* **SegPy**
* **mariadb-dyncol**
